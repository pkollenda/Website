# A productive rabbit hole

For week 33 of #TidyTuesday 2022 I had to manually select names from a dataset. So, I typed something like
```{r}
#| eval: false
filter(df, name %in% c("The Witcher", "Hamilton", "Westworld", "Sense8"))
```

Do you see what's wrong with this? No? Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you have a much healthier, more pragmatic approach to coding than I do.

I, on the other hand, was bothered by the fact that the series names were not in alphabetical order. But, *"hey"*, I thought, R is a ["well-developed, simple and effective programming language"](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), so why not use it to bring my source code into alphabetical order.

#### Obviously, I could just type my input in alphabetical order, but where is the fun in that?

The context is not really important, so I won't go into detail on what this dataset was about. The trick is super generally and applies to many situations anyways. But you can see my final plot [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/philippkollenda) and the accompanying blog post [on my website](https://www.pkollenda.com/blog.html).

## How to programatically sort your source code into alphabetical order.

My goal is to get alphabetically sorted output that I can simply copy + paste into my source file (or write to the file with `write_lines()`).

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: true
x <- c("The Witcher", "Hamilton", "Westworld", "Sense8")
print(x)
dput(sort(x))
```
Success! That last line is something I can copy. ðŸ˜ƒ And...it only took approximately 1000 hours of googling to find `dput()` ðŸ™ˆ Eventually the *Similar questions* that pop-up just before you create a stackoverflow question came to the rescue.

It would be really cool to immediately copy the output of the dput() statement to the clipboard. There is the [clipr package](https://github.com/mdlincoln/clipr) which looks promising, but that is something for another evening.
