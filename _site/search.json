    "section": "",
    "text": "I am especially excited about the possibility to quickly build websites (for blogs, teaching, sharing notes, publishing research etc.) with Quarto, without having to leave my R environment where I do all my coding anyways. Let‚Äôs get started!\n\nLet‚Äôs start by building a very simple website. I have three things on my wishlist:\n\nthe website should have multiple pages,\nan intuitive way to navigate between them and\nshow some images, code and output.\n\nWe won‚Äôt worry about hosting yet (that‚Äôs for another post) and simply use quarto.pub (more on that below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Here is how to get a website up and running in three steps\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, start a new project and choose Quarto website.\nChange content in the .qmd files and configuration in the .yml file.\nPublish to quarto pub via the terminal.\n\n\n\nHere is the final website https://philipp.quarto.pub/my-first-website But, let‚Äôs look at each of the steps in more detail.\n\nStep 1: Create the Quarto website project\nIn RStudio, we create a new project and choose Quarto website from the list of available templates. If that does not show up for you, chances are that you need to update RStudio to the latest version (i.e.¬†RStudio 2022.07.1+554 ‚ÄúSpotted Wakerobin‚Äù works).\nA click on create project will create the scaffolding for our new website:\n\nTwo .qmd files that will become pages on our website.\nA .yml file that we use to keep track of the options.\nA styles.css file that we use to customize the appearance of the website1.\n\nIf we click on ‚ÄúRender‚Äù (or use Shift + Cmd + K) the document will (hopefully) render and show up in the Viewer pane of RStudio. That‚Äôs all and we could already publish this as a functioning website (ü•≥), but let‚Äôs add at least a minimal amount of our own content.\n\n\nStep 2: Changing the content (.qmd) and the structure (.yml) of our website.\nWhen we initialized the project, Quarto graciously already created two .qmd files which will be two pages on our website and a .yml file which records settings about the structure, general options, appearance and so on.\nWe are going to change the default content of the index.qmd file and the name and content of the about.qmd file. To do that, simply open the respective .qmd file and edit what you want to change. We won‚Äôt focus here on how to author Quarto documents, but the documentation on https://quarto.org/docs/authoring is amazing. For completeness, I put the code that I used in our website at the bottom of this post.\nNow, ideally we want to see the effects of our changes immediately. There are two options. We can switch on ‚ÄúRender on Save‚Äù and see the updated page in RStudios Viewer pane whenever we save. Or ‚Äì way cooler IMHO ‚Äì we can preview the entire website by typing quarto preview in the terminal field of RStudio (next to the console, where???).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview a website without publishing it by typing quarto preview in the terminal.\n\n\n\nWhere the .qmd files tell the browser what the website should display, the .yml file tells the browser how to structure the website. This is where you change the design, add pages, choose a logo and so much more. We‚Äôll not go into detail on the site configuration yaml here and just focus on getting a simple website up-and-running, but luckily the Quarto team has you covered.\n\n\nStep 3: Publish your website.\nThis is it! It is time to let our creation leave the confines of the local computer and roam the world wide web. But we need a home address for our website and for the sake of using the simplest possible solution we will publish the website using quarto pub.\nIf you are already signed up and authenticated for Quarto Pub, great! Keep reading below.\n\n\nOtherwise click here to show the details.\n\nIf you still need to make an account, go to the quarto pub website (https://quartopub.com/), click Sign up, confirm your email and choose a username. The username will be in the URL of every website you create, so best to choose something highly professional ü§ì.\n\nOnce you created your account (or if you already had one), open https://quartopub.com (this should show an empty profile page if you have not previously created a website) and just keep it open.\nNow comes the magic. Head back to RStudio and type quarto publish quarto-pub in the terminal (termi-WHAT?). If you are logged in to quarto pub in a browser, the terminal will show ? Publish with account:, your email address on the next line and in gray the words Use another account‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be fooled (like I was). This is not an error message and the console is not trying to tell you to use another account, it‚Äôs merely asking‚Ä¶ So, confidently press Enter and it will ask about the site name. Press enter again and voil√†, Quarto will upload your .qmd and .yml files to quarto pub and publish your website.\nYou (and everyone else!) can now see your website at YOUR-USERNAME.quarto.pub/YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME/. Here is the site that I just created in during this post https://philipp.quarto.pub/my-first-website/.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nStupid mistakes that tripped me up and that you don‚Äôt need to repeat.\n\nWhere is the terminal in RStudio?\nIf you do not use the terminal often it is easy to overlook it even though it is hidden in plain sight.  ##### Why does quarto pub ask me a different name / email address‚Ä¶ When I first published this site, I diligently typed quarto publish quarto-pub in the terminal and was greeted by the message: ‚ÄúUse a different name‚Ä¶‚Äù.\n\n\nI fixed a typo but already published the site, what now?\nDon‚Äôt despair, unlike certain social media sites, quarto.pub does come with an edit button. Simply change what you want to change in the .qmd or .yml files and don‚Äôt forget to publish again via the termina. The console will ask you if you want to update the already published site‚Ä¶ yes, please! That last step is easy to miss though, because RStudio‚Äôs Render on Save and Preview make it so easy to expect that everything just updates automatically.\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the index.qmd file.\nNote that I am not actually including the first line, only the part beginning with the yaml dashes (---).\n```{r}\n---\ntitle: \"Welcome to my first website\"\n---\n\nThis is a Quarto website that I created in just a few minutes. Read about it here and find amazing resources on <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n![](images/screenshot.png)\n```\n\n\nThe content of the about.qmd file.\n---\ntitle: \"Ferries Wheels\"\n---\n\n## Some fun with ferries wheels\n\n```{r}\n#| label: ferries-plot\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n#| code-fold: true\n#| message: false\n# install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\") install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#data <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\ndata <- read_rds(\"data/wheels\")\nhighest <- data |> \n  group_by(country) |> \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"Taiwan\", \"Japan\", \"Philippines\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |> \n  select(country, height, diameter)\nggplot(highest, aes(y = fct_rev(factor(country)), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = country, yend = country, x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       # x = \"Diameter of the highest ferries wheel in the country (in meter)\"\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the highest ferries wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriewheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWe won‚Äôt worry about customizing anything yet and the file is empty anyways.‚Ü©Ô∏é"

So, I typed something like\n\nfilter(df, name %in% c(\"The Witcher\", \"Hamilton\", \"Westworld\", \"Sense8\"))\n\nDo you see what‚Äôs wrong with this? No? Congratulations üéâ, you have a much healthier, more pragmatic approach to coding than I do.\nI, on the other hand, was bothered by the fact that the series names were not in alphabetical order. But, ‚Äúhey‚Äù, I thought, R is a ‚Äúwell-developed, simple and effective programming language‚Äù, so why not use it to bring my source code into alphabetical order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe context is not really important, so I won‚Äôt go into detail on what this dataset was about. The trick is super generally and applies to many situations anyways. But you can see my final plot on Twitter and the accompanying blog post on my website.\n\n\n\n\nMy goal is to get alphabetically sorted output that I can simply copy + paste into my source file (or write to the file with write_lines()).\n\nx <- c(\"The Witcher\", \"Hamilton\", \"Westworld\", \"Sense8\")\nprint(x)\n\n[1] \"The Witcher\" \"Hamilton\"    \"Westworld\"   \"Sense8\"     \n\ndput(sort(x))\n\nc(\"Hamilton\", \"Sense8\", \"The Witcher\", \"Westworld\")\n\n\nSuccess! That last line is something I can copy. üòÉ And‚Ä¶it only took approximately 1000 hours of googling to find dput() üôà Eventually the Similar questions that pop-up just before you create a stackoverflow question came to the rescue.\nIt would be really cool to immediately copy the output of the dput() statement to the clipboard. There is the clipr package which looks promising, but that is something for another evening."
