### Welcome to my website.

I am an economist dedicated to shaping an economic and financial system where prosperity is created sustainably, distributed globally and shared by all. In my work, I focus on generating rigorous research, and translating it into actionable policy and financial innovation. Read more about [my motivation](pages/motivation.qmd).

My core expertise lies in sustainable finance, development economics and macroeconomics. In [my PhD research](pages/research.qmd), I investigated how impact investors pursue financial returns and social impact; and how farmers collectively negotiate higher prices and access to value chains. I used a mix of impact measurement, econometrics and causal inference methods. I also [taught](pages/teaching.qmd) and [presented](pages/presentations.qmd) my research at international conferences.

I currently work as a sustainable finance consultant for the World Bank Group's Long-Term Finance team in the Prosperity Global Practice. There, I co-developed policy frameworks (FAB/REACH) for sustainability-linked financial instruments, advised client countries on MRV systems and central banks on climate risk analysis, directly engaging with ministries and public and private sector stakeholders. I thrive in bridging the gap between academic research, policy development, and financial practice to drive systemic change.

I also [write shorter posts](blog.qmd), mostly about data science, #RStats and cool data for development economics.
