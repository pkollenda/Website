# A better tomorrow is possible.

I get energy from working together with others to build a better world, where prosperity is created sustainably, redistributed globally and shared by all.

My professional ambition is to help people and organizations combine data with rigorous methodologies to generate evidence that allows us to improve peopleâ€™s livelihoods through sustainable economic development.
